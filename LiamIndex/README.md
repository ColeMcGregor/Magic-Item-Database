# LiamIndex

**LiamIndex** is a Python-based system for importing, storing, and generating item inventories â€” perfect for building shops, NPC gear, enemy loot, and treasure chests for tabletop or digital games.

It supports data import from CSV/XLSX files, enrichment via the Reddit API (for descriptions/images), and flexible querying/generation based on rarity, type, attunement, and budget rules.

It has a scraping program that grabs information about an item through a combination of a link and a Reddit Developer account using PRAW, reddits API. Can grab item description and item image.
